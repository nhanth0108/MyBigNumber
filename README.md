# MyBigNumber
Write a class named: MyBigNumber which has a method named: String sum(String s1, String s2) computes the sum of s1 and s2 as integers.
S1 and s2 contain numbers from ‘0’ to ‘9’
The method will return the sum of s1 and s2
Ex: sum(“123”, “4”) will return “127”
The program requires an algorithm that implements the addition of two strings in order right to left as what the students learned the addition calculation.
You are not allowed to use these primitive type conversion methods: Integer.getInteger(), Integer.parseInt() or the similar methods perform casting from a string into number in JDK.

You can use the built in method in JDK to cast a char into a digit but your total score will be minus 2 points (Maximum core is 10 points).
Only focus on coding with an assumption that s1 and s2 are passed legally. DO NOT code method "main"". DO NOT code the input data.
You can use other programming languages such as C/C++, C#. However, please DO NOT use built-in functions for method to convert a string to number.
Using a built-on function to convert a character to a digit can be accepted. But your score will be minus as mentioned above.
